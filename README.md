## Extract_uniq_reads.py

[Compatibility: Python3]
This script is used for extracting unique reads from SAM files. The input should be one SAM file, and there must be one subdirectory named "header" to store the header information of the SAM files. In the "header" subdirectory, header information files should be named with the suffix "_header.sam". BTW, the header information can be generated by Samtools (samtools view -H).
